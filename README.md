Scala Implementation of the N-Queens Problem.

See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

To run:  Execute `sbt run`

N for the problem is set within the code.



I've been learning Scala, and my friend told me about the N-queens problem, which I had never heard of, nor attempted before.
Figured it would be a good opportunity to learn some more Scala.
